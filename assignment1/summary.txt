This assignment is your first exercise in working with a Haskell program which
is somewhat larger than just toy examples. You are given a skeleton solution to
the task and you are expected to add various missing pieces to it.

The purpose of this assignment is threefold:

1. Teach you to read and understand some already existing Haskell code;
2. Teach you to write fully functioning code: you won't get any deeper comments
   about your solution regarding the programming style before it fullfills the
   functional requirements (i.e., it works);
3. Teach you the preferred style of writing Haskell code (you may wish to look
   up the expressions "point-free style", or "point-free programming" or have a
   look at this blog post).

The assignment should be completed in pairs.
